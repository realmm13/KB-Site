            I'm a writer and podcaster exploring identity, purpose, and the courage to
            listen to your inner voice instead of staying "still small" within society's
            default rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            I love memoirs because of the messy parts—the story before the success.
            I use writing to process emotions; when I don't express what I'm feeling,
            I feel frazzled and stressed. This newsletter is my attempt to share that
            process openly.

            About the name
          </h2>

          <p>
            "Still Small" is a play on the phrase "still, small voice"—that quiet
            inner knowing that often gets drowned out by external expectations.
            This work is about learning to listen to that voice instead of
            staying "still small" within society's default rules.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif font-medium text-charcoal pt-8">
            The podcast
          </h2>

          <p>
            On the podcast, I have conversations with people about the unconventional
            choices they've made—from decisions about children and career to relationships
            and creativity. These conversations extend the themes of the newsletter into
            dialogue, offering diverse perspectives on what it means to live authentically.
